// Configuration (rename or copy to "Config.h" to use)

/*
 * For more information on setting OnStep up see http://www.stellarjourney.com/index.php?r=site/equipment_onstep and 
 * join the OnStep yahoo group at https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/onsteptelescope/info
 * 
 * The Arduino Mega2560, Teensy3.1/3.2, and some Launchpad TM4C devices are also supported (thanks to Luka.) 
 * See the Pins.h file for detailed information on the pin maps
 *
 * The RA/Az (Axis1) and Dec/Alt (Axis2) stepper driver minimum connection is as follows:
 * RA/Az :  37,35 = Dir,Step (Teensy3.2 21,20)
 * Dec/Alt: 22,24 = Dir,Step (Teensy3.2  2, 3)
 *
 * Optionally, a bluetooth or WiFi adapter (HC05, RN42, or ESP8266 for example) plugs into pins Tx1/Rx1.
 * +5VDC is normally used for the BT Adapter and +3.3VDC for the ESP8266 (make sure the regulator is sufficient to supply required current.)
 * I use two 2-wire cables for 0.1" headers.  Remember Rx goes to Tx and Tx goes to Rx. If using a Mega2560
 * be sure to get a BT module designed for 5 volt operation and signaling otherwise you'll have to design
 * and implement the level conversion hardware yourself.
